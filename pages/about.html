    <h1>What to know about MasterMind Space Edition</h1>
    <p>Mastermind is a classic board game that has been adapted for online play. It's a single-player game where your objective is to decipher a secret color code generated by our intelligent bot.</p>
    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <p>Your mission is to guess the hidden color code created by the bot in as few attempts as possible.
        Choose colors from our palette and place them on the game board as your initial guess.
        After each attempt, the bot provides feedback, represented by white and black pegs:
        White Pegs: Indicate that a color is correct but in the wrong position.
        Black Pegs: Indicate that a color is correct and in the correct position.
        Use this feedback to refine your subsequent guesses.
        Keep making guesses and adjusting your strategy until you crack the secret code or reach the maximum number of attempts.</p>
